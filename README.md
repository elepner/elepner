I'm a senior software developer at [Invarion](https://invarion.com/). I'm doing asp.net/Azure/Angular stuff currently. I used to have heavy background in ArcGIS. At Invarion I solve quite tricky algorithmical and architectual problems like in [that project](https://invarion.com/eu/products/rapidpath-online/). Also I'm responsible for architecturing and supervising cloud infrastructure in the company.
I live in GaÅ„sk, Poland.
