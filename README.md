### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Eduard Lepner
--------

I'm a senior software developer at [Invarion](https://invarion.com/). I'm doing asp.net/Azure/Angular stuff currently and all related pieces of technology that one might expect for the stack above (Azure DevOps, NGRX, RxJS, SQL, Azure SQL, DocumentDB, Azure Table Storage, Azure Service Bus etc). I have a depth of experience with ArcGIS. My role at Invarion involves solving quite tricky algorithmic and architecutre problems: here is an [example project](https://invarion.com/eu/products/rapidpath-online/) I have been working on. I am also responsible for cloud architecture and supervision of cloud infrastructure in the company.
I live in GaÅ„sk, Poland.
